# smart-contracts-events-simple-example
Simple example of smart contract events in Truffle.


This is a set of event examples in a default Truffle box (webpack box). 

Everything is vanilla except the new function in app.js and index.html to illustrate different event types against the Transfer function in Metacoin example.. Three examples are :

1. Get All Events with a watch (no config object)

2.  Watch  a specific address (with config object) for all continuing events

3. Get an array of all events from a specific event since the deployment of the contract
